# Triathlon

### Project Description
This storymap uses D3, Leaflet, and Bootstrap. A multitude of image files were used from multiple sources. And many links to various websites were used to put together a presentation to show the sport of triathlon and the impact it has had on my life and how I became more involved.

### Project Goal
This project is an attempt at show casing the variety that the sport of triathlon has to offer. There are more race options than just Ironman, and it's easier to race than most people think. It's an inclusive community that is competitive but also shows tremendous amounts of sportsmanship and "good vibes". There are also various sizes of race events from local to large scale, so that's what I try to convey through this storymap. 


### Details
Fairly simple layout with drone footage (pg 1), and pictures of racers doing all three portions (pg 2). If I have time to be fancy, I would like to show drone footage of each event if they click on the swim/bike/run picture tiles (on pg 2). I want to introduce more people to triathlon and talk about why I love it so much. So the layout will be pretty simple with stuff to look at. I think the timeline and expanding map will be a nice feature to show the growth of triathlon events all over the world. If I have time, I would like to have a tab that if clicked upon, will show various stories of inspirational triathletes, maybe after pg 4. On the credits page, I will add info if people want to sign up for a race, etc. or maybe have separate tabs for different races in the valley.
